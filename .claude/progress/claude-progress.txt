[2026-01-04T17:30:54.087429] Session checkpoint: 6/25 features complete. Current: F006, Next: F007
=== Session 2026-01-04T18:45:53Z ===
Completed: F001-F018 (18/25 features)
- X OAuth 2.0 PKCE authentication

Pending: F022-F025 polish/deployment

=== Session 2026-01-05 ===
State: IMPLEMENT
Health: HEALTHY (Next.js on port 3000)

What I Was Doing:
- Debugging X (Twitter) OAuth 2.0 PKCE authentication
- Issue: Authorize page redirect loop causing HTTP 429 rate limiting
- Verified: X Developer Portal settings (App Type: Web App/Confidential, Callback URI: http://localhost:3000/api/auth/x/callback, Website URL: http://example.com)
- Finding: OAuth implementation code is correct - issue is X's own authorize page using deprecated v1.1 API internally

Files Modified:
- .claude/hooks/require-dependencies.py - Fixed to check file existence instead of env vars
- .claude/progress/state.json - Updated timestamp
- .claude/progress/session-state.json - Updated with OAuth debugging status
- .claude/progress/checkpoint.json - Updated summary

Progress:
- Completed: 25/25 features (all implemented)
- Next: Wait for rate limit to clear, then test OAuth connection
