[2026-01-04T17:30:54.087429] Session checkpoint: 6/25 features complete. Current: F006, Next: F007
=== Session 2026-01-04T18:45:53Z ===
Completed: F001-F018 (18/25 features)
- X OAuth 2.0 PKCE authentication
- AccountConnection UI component
- PersonaEditor Settings page
- All 6 Claude agent tools with DB integration
- ToolExecutionCard for tool usage display

Pending: F022-F025 polish/deployment

=== Session 2026-01-05 ===
State: IMPLEMENT
Health: HEALTHY (Next.js on port 3000)

What I Was Doing:
- Debugging X (Twitter) OAuth 2.0 PKCE authentication
- Issue: Authorize page redirect loop causing HTTP 429 rate limiting
- Verified: X Developer Portal settings (App Type: Web App/Confidential, Callback URI: http://localhost:3000/api/auth/x/callback, Website URL: http://example.com)
- Finding: OAuth implementation code is correct - issue is X's own authorize page using deprecated v1.1 API internally

Files Modified:
- .claude/hooks/require-dependencies.py - Fixed to check file existence instead of env vars
- .claude/progress/state.json - Updated timestamp
- .claude/progress/session-state.json - Updated with OAuth debugging status
- .claude/progress/checkpoint.json - Updated summary

Progress:
- Completed: 25/25 features (all implemented)
- Next: Wait for rate limit to clear, then test OAuth connection

What I Was Doing:
- Added frequency selector (1-17 posts/day) to autonomous page with real-time save
- Implemented MCP bridge loading from .mcp.json (reads config dynamically)
- Configured selective MCP server loading (tavily, perplexity, context7, token-efficient - excluding netlify, playwriter from agent)
- Fixed restart and health scripts for dynamic path resolution (removed hardcoded paths)
- Replaced "Current Phase" with "Active Persona" display on autonomous page
- Created plan for job scheduler implementation to replace Vercel cron with local node-cron

Next Action:
- Implement job scheduler (add to plan):
  1. Add ScheduledJob model to Prisma schema
  2. Install cron package
  3. Create scheduler service (index.ts, frequency-calculator.ts)
  4. Create instrumentation.ts for server startup
  5. Update next.config.ts for instrumentation hook
  6. Modify settings API to rebuild jobs when frequency changes
  7. Create scheduler API routes
  8. Run database migration
  9. Test scheduler functionality

Plan: /Users/gurusharan/.claude/plans/compressed-pondering-lerdorf.md
Progress: 61/67 complete, 6 pending (mcp-integration phase)
Next: Create SDK helper module (F062)
