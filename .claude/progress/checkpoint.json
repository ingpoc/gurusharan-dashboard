  "summary": "Debugging X (Twitter) OAuth 2.0 PKCE authentication flow. The authorize page was redirecting in a loop, causing HTTP 429 rate limiting. Verified all X Developer Portal settings are correct (App Type: Web App/Confidential, Callback URI: http://localhost:3000/api/auth/x/callback, Website URL: http://example.com). The OAuth implementation code is correct - the issue is X's own authorize page using deprecated v1.1 API internally."
