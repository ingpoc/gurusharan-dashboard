I want to brain storm with you first, dont make any change for now, my vision is that claude agent will
  be doing the posting autonomously based on the persona, configuration (schedule, frequency), the whole
  idea to becoming a content creator is to post something which really help ppl, first I myself should want
  to become consumer of it. Eventually we want to earn money which will come when engagement becomes
  bigger , likes, repost, bookmarking etc. You might want to research on that as well on your posting
  strategy, I have taken premium subscription for X account, you can check the post length allowed , also
  through X API what can you check for each post that you posted, In X api i have taken free plan. All of
  these you have to know before you post, Also research first based on the persona and the topic , and ppl
  who would subscribe to that topic what would they be interested in today related to that topic. You can
  also think on researching ppl who are expert on that topic and have high subscribers what do they post.
  But your posting has to be unique if you just copy them why would ppl subscribe to you they would rather
  subscribe to them. Now to do all this which tools should claude sdk have to do this autonomously. Any
  Agent skills or MCP servers or hooks, you can use @agent-agent-sdk-dev:agent-sdk-verifier-ts to research
  on configuration. Ultrathink on first principles on what is the most optmized version to build this.
  Remember the Claude Agent SDK will evolve to do multiple other thing apart from posting X, Think of it
  like there be base layer of Claude Agent SDK then on top of it, there is x-content-dashboard layer there
  will also be upwork project manager layer which will look for job opportunities on work and take project
  , so modularization is very important. of layers and tools . Which is why there is root project and
  inside it there is x-content-dashboard which should like move to src.
